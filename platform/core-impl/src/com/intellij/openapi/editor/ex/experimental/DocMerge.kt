   * Apply them one after another. The offset of each op indexes the text after all the ops before
   * it. So the text of the receiver, with every op applied in turn, equals the text of [branch]. A
   * text between two ops need not be the text of any version.
   *
   * Each op is an insert or a delete, and no op is empty. A merge that changes no text has no ops,
   * but two ops can still cancel each other. The list cannot change, and every call returns the
   * same list.
   *
   * A move arrives as an insert and a delete with move offsets, as `DocumentEvent.getMoveOffset`
   * gives them, when the moved text arrives unchanged. Otherwise it arrives as plain ops.
   *
   * For a fast-forward, the first call replays the change. It throws when the ops do not build the
   * text of [branch], which happens only when the two branches broke the agent contract.
