//! The fixtures the worker and lease suites share. Hermetic: no VM, no network, no Bazel.
//!
//! Two seams, and they are the two the production code already has. The hypervisor is the shared fake `tart` of
//! [`HostPool`], and the guest is [`FakeGuests`]: every worker's channel answers one pool-wide answer and records
//! into one log. What is left here is what only this crate can build: a [`Manager`] with the suite's poll bounds.
//!
//! A Windows host has the Docker pool only, so the Tart fixtures and the run-process helpers are Unix only.
