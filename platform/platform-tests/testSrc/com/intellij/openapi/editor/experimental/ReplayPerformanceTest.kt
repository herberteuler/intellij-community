/**
 * A benchmark, not a regression test: it measures what the replay pays to REPORT its output.
 *
 * [DocBranchPerformanceTest] cannot isolate this cost, because its runs have whatever length
 * its typing gives them. These scenarios instead fix the run length and vary the insert
 * position, which are the two things the report cost depends on.
 *
 * Why the position matters: the full replay builds the text in a `StringBuilder`, and an
 * insert shifts everything after it. A history that always inserts at the front therefore
 * pays the document length per insert. A history that appends pays nothing. So the front
 * case is the worst case for a report, and the append case is the best.
 *
 * [benchmarkSubtest] times every row with the platform benchmark framework. Compare the rows of
 * one run, and not the milliseconds of two builds. This benchmark once measured a 16x spread
 * between two runs of one unchanged build. The `len 1` row of a sweep is the control. One unit
 * per run leaves a per-character report and a per-run report the same work, so a ratio to that
 * row cancels the load out. Divide a published time by the passes of its row first.
