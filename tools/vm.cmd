# `vm` - the Air UI-lane controller, running the Rust binary Bazel builds
# (`@community//tools/vm:vm`, one file, always optimized).
#
# Same dual sh/CMD polyglot shape as bt.cmd. Seven decisions shape it: bt.cmd shares 1 and 2, and 3 to 7
# are where the two differ. Each is a decision, not a simplification:
#
# 1. **No cache, and no version key**, as in bt.cmd since it stopped wrapping a pinned bun. This wrapper
#    resolves a binary built from working-copy sources, which change on every edit and are keyed by
#    nothing. There is no honest cache key, and the
#    failure a wrong one produces is this port's worst case: a silently stale controller judging a lane
#    and reporting a verdict about code it did not run.
#    `../../plugins/air/docs/decisions/0105-the-ui-lane-controller-is-go.md` (superseded by ADR 0059, the port to Rust)
#    records the same trap already paid for once - an `lstat`-based freshness check on a `go_cross_binary`
#    degraded to "always reinstall", passed its whole suite, and failed on hardware. So every invocation runs
#    `bazel run --script_path`: the build *is* the freshness guarantee.
#
#    The cost is ~1.3 s of analysis, warm. A lane iteration is ~196 s, and even `status` reaches a
#    hypervisor. Against that this is noise - and unlike bt, this tool cannot function without a working
#    host Bazel anyway, because preparing a build is what `run`, `shard` and `flake` do first.
#
# 2. **`AIR_VM_BIN` overrides everything on the sh half, checked first.** It names an explicit binary and
#    skips Bazel entirely: a debugger attaching to it, a hand-built binary, or one binary held for the whole of a
#    comparison rather than rebuilt between its halves. There is no parity gate behind it any more; ADR
#    0174 deleted the Go implementation it compared against. The CMD half reads it the same way (note 7).
#
# 3. **No `--refresh`.** There is nothing to drop.
#
# 4. **Wrapper failures exit 78, where bt.cmd's exit 6.** Both wrappers report their own infrastructure
#    failure - no Bazel, no binary - with a code the tool they launch cannot produce, so a caller can tell
#    "the tool did not start" from "the tool answered". For BT that code *is* 6, because its `exit::INFRA`
#    is 6 and means the same thing: the run said nothing about the tests. For this controller 6 is
#    `Exit::TESTS_FAILED`, a verdict - a red lane leaves with it - so 6 here would make a build failure
#    indistinguishable from a red lane. 78 is `EX_CONFIG` and the one sysexits code the controller does not
#    use (it uses 1, 2, 6, 65, 66, 69, 70, 73, 75, 77). **The asymmetry is deliberate; do not harmonize
#    the two wrappers on one number.**
#
# 5. **`--config=air-lane-linux` on the build.** The controller's own lane builds pass the same config
#    (`host_bazel_argv` in `vm/crates/avl-vm/src/lane/bazel.rs`), and its options are part of Bazel's
#    analysis key. Without it, each call of this wrapper discards the analysis of the last lane build. It is
#    the config of the default guest, so a lane build for a macOS guest still pays one analysis.
#
# 6. **Where the build's output goes depends on who reads stderr.** For a pipe, it goes to a log file and
#    reaches stderr only when the build fails. A refusal envelope goes to stderr, so a Bazel line there
#    (`WARNING: Build options ... have changed`) came before the envelope, and `jq` on stderr failed. A green
#    build says nothing a caller needs, so it says nothing. For a terminal, the output goes straight to stderr:
#    a person then sees a cold build of the controller move, which is the one phase the controller cannot
#    report, because it does not exist yet. The CMD half cannot tell a terminal from a pipe, so it always
#    takes the pipe path: the output goes to a log file, and reaches stderr only when the build fails.
#
# 7. **The CMD half runs the controller natively.** A Windows host drives only the Docker backend, through
#    `docker.exe`, and the controller refuses a Tart or a Parallels selection there. The CMD half follows the
#    sh half step for step, with the shapes of the CMD half of bt.cmd: the root from `%~dp0`, the arguments
#    collected one at a time, and the binary from the first token of the launcher's last line. It has no
#    `readlink -f`, because the launcher of a Windows `bazel run` names the binary itself.
#
# Everything else is bt.cmd's, for bt.cmd's reasons: the bash pinning, reading the launcher's last line,
# the `readlink -f` fallback, and exporting BUILD_WORKSPACE_DIRECTORY while unsetting any leaked RUNFILES_*.

# A .cmd file has no shebang, so an ENOEXEC fallback picks the interpreter - dash on Ubuntu, bash on
# macOS. Pin it, as tests.cmd and bt.cmd do, rather than leaving the wrapper's behaviour to the caller.
