//! The machine a pool runs on, and the questions whose answer depends on which one it is.
//!
//! # A match per question
//!
//! [`Machine`] is the configured backend, exactly one of [`Tart`], [`Parallels`] and [`Docker`]. It answers the
//! questions a caller asks without caring which backend it has, and each answer is a `match` delegating to the
//! backend's own method of the same name:
//!
//! - **the version gate** - [`Machine::require_available`]: a floor with an escape hatch on Tart, a registered
//!   Apple-Virtualization VM on Parallels;
//! - **the guest-exec argv shape** - [`Machine::guest_argv`]: `tart exec [-i] <worker> <argv…>` and `docker exec [-i]
//!   <worker> <argv…>` versus `prlctl exec <worker> "<one shell string>"`, the single difference every guest call
//!   site used to know;
//! - **liveness** - [`Machine::running`]: Tart's worker is a host process the controller owns, identified by a pid
//!   plus its `ps` start time and command; Parallels' worker is a VM it does not own, and the only honest question
//!   is `prlctl status`. Docker's worker is a container the controller owns by name, so liveness is `docker
//!   inspect`;
//! - **the share mount** - [`Machine::share_mount`]: VirtioFS on Tart and Parallels, bind mounts on Docker.
//!
//! The lifecycle of a worker needs the manager's host state, locks and guest channel, so its operations are methods
//! of the worker manager, in the lifecycle module of the worker module. Each is one `match` on the machine too, and
//! each arm calls the body in the backend's own file under `worker/`. Every backend answers each lifecycle operation.
//! An `unsupported` refusal is an answer that keeps its code, and the next section says why. The lifecycle covers
//! these operations:
//!
//! - the readiness gate of a lease operation and the readiness gate of a lease release;
//! - whether a lease release may skip the guest of a worker that runs nothing;
//! - the start and the stop of a worker;
//! - `pool init` and `pool gc`;
//! - the unmaking of a slot that `pool recycle` runs, and the stop and the delete of the Lima engine of a Docker pool.
//!
//! Every caller of the other operations already knows which backend it has, so it asks the concrete backend. These
//! operations are:
//!
//! - the share declaration and the suspend;
//! - the root-disk growth, the clone and the delete;
//! - the VM state;
//! - the sealed-golden receipt and the provenance receipt;
//! - the console-login wait;
//! - the Peekaboo exec as the current user.
//!
//! # Why every refusal keeps its code
//!
//! An operation a backend cannot do answers [`UNSUPPORTED_CODE`] rather than a zero value, because callers automate
//! against it: `pool gc` on Parallels, Peekaboo on Tart, and a Parallels-plus-Linux pairing are all
//! `unsupported_backend_operation` at exit 2. Stubbing them to "succeeded, did nothing" would turn a refusal a
//! caller can branch on into a worker that silently never got its shares.
