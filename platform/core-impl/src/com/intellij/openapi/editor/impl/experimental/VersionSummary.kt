/**
 * What one graph value knows, by agent. The reference implementation calls this a
 * `VersionSummary`, and builds it with `summarizeVersion`.
 *
 * One integer per agent is enough. The per-agent seqs of a graph ascend and leave no gap,
 * which [com.intellij.openapi.editor.experimental.EventGraph.append] enforces, so a graph
 * holds exactly the seqs `[0, endSeq(agent))` of every agent it knows.
 *
 * That is what makes a delta merge possible. A summary costs one entry per AGENT, so two
 * replicas work out what they do not share without either one walking its own history.
