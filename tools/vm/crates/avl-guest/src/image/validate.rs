//! `validate-image`: proving a freshly provisioned macOS image is the image the pipeline pinned, before Packer
//! seals it.
//!
//! Runs inside the guest as a `shell` provisioner of `air-macos.pkr.hcl`: after `provision-image`, after
//! sanitizing, immediately before the seal. Everything asserted here was asserted by the deleted
//! `validate-guest.sh`, whose failed `[[ ]]` printed nothing at all - so what this verb buys is that every check
//! names what it looked at and what it found.
//!
//! `air-audit-public-image` stays a shell script this verb execs. It is the publishability gate, argued path by
//! path against the image's own filesystem, and moving that argument into another language would move it away
//! from the reviewers who wrote it.
//!
//! **Refusals are classified by code, not by exit status**: Packer's `shell` provisioner treats every nonzero
//! status alike. Messages quote what a command answered, which is the opposite of the rule every other verb
//! follows: here the reader is a human looking at a Packer build log, the audit's own finding is the entire
//! diagnosis of an audit failure, and every quotation is attributed and length-capped.
