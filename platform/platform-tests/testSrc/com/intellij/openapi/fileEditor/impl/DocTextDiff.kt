/**
 * Recovers an edit script from two states of one document.
 *
 * The caller knows the base text and the target text. The caller does not know the edits that
 * produced the target. [diff] returns a list of [DocTextOp] that reproduces the target from the base.
 *
 * The returned script is not the real history. The text cannot record the real history. A user who
 * types a word and then deletes it leaves no trace. The script is one of many that give the same
 * result, so treat it as a reconstruction and not as the truth.
 *
 * The algorithm runs in four steps.
 * 1. It trims the shared prefix and the shared suffix. This is linear, and it finds the one region
 *    that changed.
 * 2. It grows that region to whole lines, so the ops get a line boundary to sit on.
 * 3. It compares the region by line. A line is a coarse anchor, and the alphabet is small.
 * 4. It compares each changed line block by character. The refinement stays local and cheap.
 *
 * A whole document comparison by character is the alternative. It is quadratic in the worst case,
 * and it splits one edit into many small ops. Each op becomes an event that the graph keeps
 * forever, so a small op count matters more here than a small edit distance.
 *
 * Step 3 builds one `String` per line, and that is on purpose. A hand written scan that hashes the
 * characters where they lie and never builds a line looks cheaper. It measures 1.3 to 2.3 times
 * slower. `String.substring`, `String.hashCode` and `String.equals` are JDK intrinsics that the JIT
 * turns into vector code, and a scalar Kotlin loop cannot match them. Do not try it again.
