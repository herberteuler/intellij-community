/**
 * Turns the reports of a merge into ops, applies them to the text, and records them. The recorded
 * ops are the op stream of [DocMerge.ops].
 *
 * The sink is a state machine over one pending op: [NoPending], [PendingInsert], [PendingDelete], or
 * [PendingMove]. A report that continues the pending op joins it:
 * - an insert at the end of a pending insert extends its fragment;
 * - a delete that starts inside a pending insert and ends at its end shortens the fragment. The
 *   new side deleted text that it inserted itself, so no op brings that text at all;
 * - a delete at the position of a pending delete extends it, as the Delete key does;
 * - a delete that ends at the position of a pending delete extends it backwards, as a backspace
 *   does;
 * - a move delete at the source of a pending move removes the next piece of the source. The last
 *   piece emits the pair with move offsets, when the source holds the fragment.
 *
 * Any other report flushes the pending op and starts a new one. A flushed move leaves as plain ops,
 * and a move delete that continues no move acts as a delete. A move op never joins a neighbour.
 *
 * Each join costs O(1), because it never moves the characters of the pending fragment. The walk
 * reports one span per run, so the joins pay off across runs. Two runs that land side by side
 * arrive as two reports and leave as one op.
 *
 * The sink is single use, and one merge owns it. [result] and [ops] finish it, and a report after
 * that fails.
