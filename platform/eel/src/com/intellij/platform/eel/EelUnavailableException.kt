/**
 * Thrown when an EEL cannot be accessed or initialized.
 *
 * This exception indicates that the target execution environment (such as a remote machine,
 * Docker container, or WSL instance) is temporarily or permanently unavailable.
 *
 * Common scenarios include:
 * - Docker daemon connection failures
 * - Container not found or stopped
 * - Remote SSH connection issues
 * - Environment-specific setup errors
 *
 * Any method of an Eel API may throw this exception. On a bug in Eel, a method can also throw another exception.
 *
 * The exception should contain a localized user-facing message explaining the specific
 * reason for unavailability, and optionally wrap the underlying cause.
 *
 * The direct subclasses are the kinds of the error: [CommunicationFailure], [Conclusive] and its subclass [IntendedExit].
 * Use an exhaustive `when` over the kinds. Any module can add a subclass of a kind.
 *
 * The constructor takes only the cause, and each kind holds the message.
 * So the constructor does not conflict with the factory function [EelUnavailableException].
 *
 * @param cause Optional underlying exception that caused the unavailability
