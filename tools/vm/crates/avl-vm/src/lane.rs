//! Lanes: selector resolution for the controller, the host Bazel build, the guest launch environment, and the

//!
//! What a UI worker is allowed to run and how it is built: lane and selector resolution against `bt`
//! ([`lanes`], [`affected`]), the host-side Bazel build ([`bazel`]), and the environment the guest launches its
//! daemon with ([`env`]) and the run secrets a run hands it as files ([`secrets`]). Beside them, the commands that observe or reach into a leased worker without running tests
//! ([`observe`]).
//!
//! Deliberately independent of the daemon that consumes it: resolution is pure and testable without a VM, and
//! keeping it here is what lets both the run path and the daemon lifecycle reach it without either depending on
//! the other.
