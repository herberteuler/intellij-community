/**
 * Tests the auto merge of a disk change into a document that holds unsaved edits.
 *
 * The case is one an agent creates. The user opens a file and types. An agent rewrites the same file
 * on disk. Neither side knows about the other, and the disk holds only a text, not a history. So the
 * IDE has to recover a history for the disk change and merge it.
 *
 * Every test runs the same seven steps, and [assertAutoMerge] checks each one.
 * 1. A saved [DocBranch] holds the text that the disk also holds.
 * 2. The user forks it and types. Those edits reach no file.
 * 3. An agent writes a new text to the file.
 * 4. [DocTextDiff] reads the saved text and the disk text, and returns the ops.
 * 5. A second fork applies those ops, so the disk change becomes a branch with a history.
 * 6. The two branches merge.
 * 7. The merged text holds both sides.
 *
 * Each test states the four texts in full, so the reader sees the saved document, sees what each
 * side did to it, and sees what the merge produced. The ops that step 4 recovers stay out of sight
 * on purpose. [DocTextDiffTest] pins those, and repeating them here would tie a merge test to the
 * offsets that the diff happens to choose.
 *
 * Two rules of the merge decide the outcome, and both are visible below.
 * - The merge drops no edit. A user keystroke survives even when the agent deleted the text around it.
 * - Two inserts at one position order by the agent name. The agent branch is named "disk" and the
 *   user branch is named "user", so the disk text comes first.
