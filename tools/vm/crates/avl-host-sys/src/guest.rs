//! What a worker VM has to be on the inside before a host-built Bazel output can run in it, and every command this
//! controller sends through the exec channel to get it there.
//!
//! What this module owns is everything that happens *inside* a running VM: the mount the controller takes over
//! from the guest's own boot automount and the remount sweep that invalidates it, the parity layout that gives the
//! guest the host's absolute paths, TCC admission, SSH host-key uniqueness, the guest agent's install, storage
//! readiness, and the run supervisor's invocation.
//!
//! What it does not own is either half of getting there. How a share is *declared* is [`crate::share`]'s -
//! [`SharedFolder`](crate::share::SharedFolder) and [`shares`](crate::share::shares) compose it and each backend
//! renders it its own way - and how a command *reaches* the guest is [`Channel`]'s. Both are consumed here
//! and neither is restated, which is why nothing here names a backend except where a macOS guest and a Linux one
//! genuinely differ: TCC, an Aqua session, an APFS container, a sealed golden's SSH identity. Those branch on
//! [`Config::guest_os`], never on the hypervisor.
//!
//! # A session, not a triple
//!
//! Almost every step takes the operation context, the settings, the channel into one worker and the reporter its
//! notes go to. [`Guest`] is those four borrowed together, so a step is `guest.remount_shares()` rather than a
//! function of four arguments repeated at forty call sites.
//!
//! # Host paths are a precondition, not a side effect
//!
//! The resolved host paths live behind [`Config::host_repo`], which refuses to answer before
//! [`ensure_host_paths`] has run and names that function in its refusal - so the readers here propagate that
//! refusal instead of resolving on demand. One resolver, one `git rev-parse`, and a caller that skipped it learns
//! what it skipped rather than declaring a share at the empty path.
