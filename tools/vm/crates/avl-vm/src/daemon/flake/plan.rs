/// The order suspects are the one instrument that tells the two live hypotheses apart: `first_trial_only` says the
/// failure belongs to a cold state the first trial alone met; `after_first_trial` says something the first trial
/// *left behind* is what later trials fail on - the shape "a warm carrier poisons its successor" would take, and the
/// shape a per-class pass ratio cannot see at all. Two properties of a run decide what they mean, so both are
/// published beside them:
///
/// - `selectionShape`: a `--lane` chain repeats a whole lane, a selector chain repeats one class standalone. The
///   decisive experiment - class A then class B, chained warm - is `flake --lane ui --reset none --filter
///   include-classname=.*(A|B).*`, a two-class lane.
/// - `positionalEvidence`: trial ordinals are chain positions only on one worker. Across N workers each chain has its
///   own first trial while the order signature knows only the globally lowest ordinal, so a positional signal is
///   diluted rather than wrong; `trialPlan` lets a reader recover what the ordinals flattened.
