# **This variable is the Bazel dependency the image pipeline did not have**, and it binds `image validate` as
# much as `image build`: Packer's `file` provisioner stats its source during `packer validate`, so no
# configuration check can skip the binary. `scripts/lib.sh` owns the resolution and states what that costs the
# operator who has to satisfy it. Why the pipeline took the dependency on, and why the image still contains no
# Bazel, is ADR 0108 - `plugins/air/docs/decisions/0108-the-guest-half-of-the-image-pipeline-is-go.md`.

  # then passes while proving nothing. The two `environment_vars` blocks this replaces were exactly that
  # duplicate.

  # Each value is quoted so that an empty variable arrives as an empty argument, which the guest refuses by

  # every later flag pairs with its neighbour, so the guest still refuses - it reads the flags in pairs - but
  # it blames the token that landed in a flag's place: `validate-image does not accept "24"`. Both fail the
