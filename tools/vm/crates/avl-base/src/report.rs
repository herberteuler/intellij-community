//! The controller's command envelope and its progress fan-out.
//!
//! The contract is the one an agent depends on, and it is deliberately narrow:
//!
//! - A successful command writes exactly one `{"schemaVersion":1,"ok":true,"command":…,"data":…}` object to
//!   **stdout** and exits 0.
//! - A failed command writes exactly one `{…,"ok":false,"command":…,"error":{code,message,details}}` object to
//!   **stderr** and exits nonzero.
//! - Progress, when asked for (`--stream`), is NDJSON on **stderr** and never on stdout, so a caller can read the
//!   one envelope off stdout without knowing whether progress was on. In human mode the same progress is prose on
//!   stderr; [`crate::plain`] renders it, or a renderer of the caller's.
//!
//! Nothing here decides *what* a command answers; it decides how an answer and a refusal are shaped.
