/**
 * A version of an [EventGraph]: the paper's `Version(G)`, the set of events with no children.
 * The paper also calls this set the frontier.
 *
 * A version identifies a document state: `Events(V)` is the set of all events at or before it,
 * and a replay of that set is the document at this version.
 *
 * A version names its heads by event id. Under the agent contract of [DocBranch], one event id
 * names one event in every graph. So a version means the same in every graph that holds its
 * heads, such as a graph that merged the one that made it. A graph checks only that it holds the
 * event ids, and not that they name the same events.
 *
 * Two versions are [equals] when they hold the same heads. Under the agent contract, they then name
 * the same events. A version from [of] is the exception.
 *
 * The value is immutable, and any thread may read it.
