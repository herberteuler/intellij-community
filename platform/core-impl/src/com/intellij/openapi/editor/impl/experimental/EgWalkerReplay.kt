/**
 * The Eg-walker replay: rebuilds the document at a version from the event graph.
 * [ReplayWalker] holds the state and does the work; this is the entry point.
 *
 * This is a direct port of the reference implementation: `src/index.ts` of
 * https://github.com/josephg/eg-walker-reference at the commit `7287f4bc2c05`. A function that
 * the reference also has keeps the reference's name, so the two stay easy to compare. A helper
 * that only this port needs gets a descriptive name.
 *
 * The walk keeps the document at two versions at once. The *prepare* version is where the next
 * event was authored. The *effect* version has every walked event applied. The walk moves the
 * prepare version to each event's parents, applies the event, and reports the effect to a [Sink].
 *
 * Three documents therefore carry a position, and the names keep them apart. An `offset`
 * belongs to an op or an event, and it indexes the document at the PARENT version, which is
 * what the public `DocumentTextOp.offset` means. A `preparePos` indexes the prepare version, and an
 * `effectPos` indexes the effect version. A bare `pos` names no document, so the code does
 * not use one.
 *
 * The walk is run-length encoded on both sides. One item covers the units that one step applies,
 * which is usually a whole run. A step consumes as much of a run as the walk ranges hold. An item
 * splits only where an op needs a boundary inside it: a concurrent insert, a partial delete, or a
 * partial retreat or advance. Costs: the items sit in an [ItemTree], so a lookup costs O(log n) in
 * the items of the walked region, and a sequential run reuses a cached cursor. The search for a
 * right parent is a lookup too. The Fugue scan still visits the concurrent items before the place
 * of the new item, as in the reference. An item there that shares the left origin and the right
 * parent of the new item needs no index. The run-length encoding keeps the item count small.
