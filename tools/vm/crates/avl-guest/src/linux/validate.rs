//! `validate-guest`: proving a provisioned Linux worker can run a UI lane, before a lane discovers it cannot.
//!
//! Runs as root immediately after `provision-guest`, on every boot. Every check exists because its absence was
//! quiet: a worker whose C library is not the one the JBR is built against, whose X server never came up, whose
//! window manager never registered, or whose runtime cannot resolve one shared object still accepts a run. The
//! display failure surfaces minutes later as an IDE that cannot open a window, and the missing `.so` as one SEVERE
//! `Failed to preload Skiko` line in `idea.log` that nobody reads while the lane goes on measuring nothing.
//!
//! # What it does not hold
//!
//! **No package list and no soname-to-package mapping.** `avl_host_sys::guest::linux::GUEST_PACKAGES` does not arrive here at all; this
//! verb reads what the guest *has*: the C library, the display, and the shared objects under the staged runtime
//! root. A package added to that list is covered here without being named here twice.
//!
//! **No Node check.** That is `check-node`: this verb runs before the controller mounts the Bazel share the Node
//! archive is read through, so a Node check here refused every boot ahead of the staging it was meant to prove.
