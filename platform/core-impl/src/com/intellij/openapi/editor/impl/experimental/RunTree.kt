/**
 * A persistent, append-only sequence of runs, searched by an ascending int key. The run tree of a
 * graph keys a run by its lvStart; the tree of one agent keys it by its seq.
 *
 * The layout is a 32-way B+tree with a tail, as in Clojure's vector. Every leaf in the tree is
 * full, and the newest runs wait in the tail until [WIDTH] of them fill a leaf. Every node keeps an
 * [IntArray] with the first key of each child. So a search by key descends on primitive arrays,
 * and it loads no run before the leaf. A binary search over a flat array of runs instead loads a
 * run at every probe, and that measured slower.
 *
 * Every node except the ones on the rightmost path is full. So the index of a run follows from its
 * path by arithmetic, and a search by index needs no count per node.
 *
 * An append copies the tail, and every [WIDTH]th append also copies the rightmost path. The old
 * tree stays valid and shares every other node. The tree is immutable, and every field is final.
