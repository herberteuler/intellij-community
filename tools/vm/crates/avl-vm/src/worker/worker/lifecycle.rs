//! The worker lifecycle and its one dispatch. This file holds these parts:
//!
//! - [`Timings`], the bounds of the poll loops;
//! - [`StartState`] and [`StopState`], what a start or a stop found;
//! - the lifecycle operations of [`Manager`]. Each is one `match` on the [`Machine`], and each arm calls the body in
//!   the file of its backend: `worker/tart.rs`, `worker/parallels.rs` and `worker/docker.rs`;
//! - [`Manager::require_unleased`], the lease guard of a lifecycle operation;
//! - [`Manager::finish_linux_start`], the Linux half of a boot. A Tart Linux worker and a Docker worker share it.
//!
//! A backend that cannot do an operation answers [`unsupported`], which keeps the refusal code a caller branches on.
