//! The command line: the clap tree, which renders the help, and how a parse becomes an invocation or a refusal.
//!
//! Three things about it are worth knowing before editing it.
//!
//! # A parse failure answers in the form the caller asked for
//!
//! A refusal from the parse itself - an argument clap cannot place, an option with no value - has to be reported
//! in the form the caller asked for, and the parse that would have discovered the form is the one that just
//! failed. So clap reads a failed command line a second time, with `ignore_errors` ([`read_partially`]): it keeps
//! what it parsed, and an argument it cannot place is left out of that reading, so the reading reaches a later
//! `--text` and names the command. Without it, `vm status --no-such-option --text` would answer a JSON envelope to
//! a caller reading prose. clap's grammar decides what a value is: a token that it reads as an option is not the
//! value of the option before it. The options clap cannot refuse by shape (`--backend`, `--lease-file`) are read as
//! plain values and refused after a successful parse, when the form is known.
//!
//! # The value of a command option stays that value
//!
//! Global options are accepted before or after the command and anywhere before a literal `--`, but a value is
//! never one: in `lease acquire --holder --text`, `--text` is the holder. The tokens after `--` belong to the
//! command (`exec` and `peekaboo` pass them to the guest), so nothing reads them.
//!
//! # PROGRAM is a literal path
//!
//! The help text names [`PROGRAM`], the wrapper's repository-relative path, everywhere a command is spelled. The
//! usage text is documentation an agent copies verbatim into its next command, and the repository's
//! tool-permission rules match literal argv prefixes (`community/.ai/tool-permissions.json`), so only this spelling
//! runs without a prompt. The prose *error* prefix stays `vm:`, the reporter's program name, because that prefix
//! says which tool spoke.

/// The paragraphs under the help of `vm`: the pools, the global options, and the form of the output.
const AFTER_HELP: &str = "--backend names a pool: docker (the default) is the Ubuntu guest in a container, with its own \
air-docker-N slots and an image the controller builds; on macOS its engine is a Lima VM the controller starts, and \
elsewhere it is the engine DOCKER_HOST names or the host's own. linux is a Tart-hosted Ubuntu guest with its own \
air-linux-N slots, tart is the same hypervisor with a sealed macOS guest, and parallels is the single pre-existing \
macOS VM. A command without --backend, such as pool stop, acts on the docker pool. A lease receipt records the \
selection, so later receipt-bearing commands infer it.

Global options, accepted before or after the command and anywhere before a literal --: --json and --text choose the \
output form, --stream adds NDJSON progress, --backend selects the pool, and --lease-file passes the receipt. So \
\"run --stream flow-x\" and \"--stream run flow-x\" are the same command. The value of a command option stays that \
value: in \"lease acquire --holder --text\", --text is the holder. --help (-h), before the command, prints this text \
- as JSON data under --json, as prose under --text; after the command it prints that command's own help the same \
way.

The form follows the reader: text when stdout is a terminal, JSON when it is not. --json and --text choose it. In \
JSON, success writes one envelope to stdout and failure writes one to stderr; --stream additionally emits NDJSON \
progress on stderr without changing the final envelope. In text, progress is prose on stderr, with a status footer \
redrawn in place when stderr is a terminal too. Acquisition returns a mode-0600 receipt path; the receipt is the \
only accepted worker handle.";

        "Builds the target on the host and runs one selection in the guest's persistent daemon against its warm IDE. \
Test-code changes are pushed over HTTP and need no remount, and the IDE relaunches only when product inputs change.

The selection is a flow id, a suite id, --changed PATH..., a TestClass or FQN[#method], or --lane {lanes}. A flow id \
selects every generated suite whose scenarios tell or walk the flow, and a suite id selects that one suite, as one \
lane's tag and one class filter per suite. An unknown id names the nearest ids, and a flow no generated suite tests \
is refused, because an iteration that runs nothing is not a passing run. With --changed, every argument that is not \
an option is a changed path, so \"--changed A B\" and \"--changed A --changed B\" are the same run, and a change no \
generated suite covers is refused, naming each path.

For a flow, a suite or --changed without --lane: one iteration per reached lane, in the order {lanes}, on one worker \
of the selected backend, in one reply. More than one lane answers {{worker, lanes: [{{lane, exitCode, code, message, \
run}}], notRun, hasFailures, lease}}. The exit code is the worst lane: 0 green, 6 red, and any other refusal above \
both. An iteration that leaves no report stops the run, and notRun names each lane it did not reach. --lane L runs \
only lane L. An explicit-only lane ({explicit}) runs only when --lane or its own class names it: no flow, suite or \
--changed reaches it, and shard and flake refuse it with explicit_only_lane, because each scenario spends a billed turn.

Without --lease-file, run builds on the host first, then leases one worker for the iteration and releases it on \
every exit; the reply adds lease {{holder, worker, disposition}}. An interrupt keeps the lease and names its receipt. \
With --lease-file it runs on that receipt's worker: the warm inner loop.

--filter narrows what the iteration runs, on top of whatever the lane or selector already asks for; it is \
repeatable, and OPTION is one of {filters}.

--test-env NAME=@- hands the guest test JVM a secret read from a pipe, as in \"central login export | vm.cmd run \
--lane ui-live --test-env AIR_LIVE_CENTRAL_LOGIN=@-\", so no host file exists. --test-env NAME=@FILE reads a host \
file instead. The guest gets a file, never a variable, because the daemon's environment is fixed at boot. The option \
is repeatable and run's alone, and @- may appear once; stdin on a terminal is refused. Each source is read once before \
any lease, and refused when it is missing, not a regular file, over 1 MiB, or holds fewer than 16 bytes. It travels \
on the exec channel's stdin to AIR_VM_RUN_SECRETS/NAME, a 0600 file on the guest's tmpfs, and is removed when the \
iteration ends or an interrupt abandons it. A fetched artifact that holds a value refuses the run with \
secret_in_artifact and is moved aside."
