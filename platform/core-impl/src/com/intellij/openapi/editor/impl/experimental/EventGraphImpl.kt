/**
 * See [EventGraph]. An immutable value: the closed runs in a persistent [RunTree], the same runs
 * by agent in an [AgentIndex], then the newest run, the [tail]. Together they cover the lvs
 * `[0, size)`.
 *
 * Every append returns a new value, and the new trees share every node they do not change with
 * the old ones. So two siblings of one value append each on their own, and neither copies the
 * history. No value holds anything that another value can change.
 *
 * The tail stays out of the trees, because an append that continues it replaces it with a longer
 * run (see [StoredRun.tryAppend]). The next append that does not continue the tail closes it
 * into the trees.
 *
 * Thread safety: nothing here is mutable. Every field is final, every structure it reaches is
 * immutable, and nothing writes a parents array after construction. So a thread that obtains a
 * value, even through a data race, sees the whole value as it was built. The holder of "the
 * current value" is the only place that needs a publication, and it is outside this class.
 *
 * Only the empty graph has no tail. [checkTail] enforces that when a graph is built, and
 * [requireTail] relies on it.
