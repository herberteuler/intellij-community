//! The one fake hypervisor, and the answer files it reads.
//!
//! Eight host suites need a hypervisor they can point `TART_BIN` or `AIR_VM_PARALLELS_BIN` at, and each of them once
//! grew its own shell script over the subset of verbs its paths reached. The copies then drifted: `list` answered a
//! JSON fixture in one suite and a hard-coded `[]` in another, `--version` honoured an exit-code file in one copy
//! and not in the others. This is their union - one script, every verb, and every answer in a file beside it - so
//! what a suite gets is decided by what that suite seeds rather than by which copy it inherited.
//!
//! It stays a real process on purpose. The argv shape is half of what these suites check - the `--dir=` share
//! grammar, the guest argv, whether a tty was asked for - and an in-process mock would agree with whatever it was
//! passed. The version floor arrives as a parameter rather than being read from the Tart backend, because that
//! crate's own tests use this one and a dependency back would close a cycle.
//!
//! # The binary name is the backend
//!
//! The script serves every backend, and it reads its own name to decide which one it is. That is not a
//! convenience: `tart` and `prlctl` are two programs, and the one thing the two backends genuinely disagree about
//! is how a command reaches the guest. `tart exec` takes an argv, so the fake `tart` matches on the whole argv.
//! `prlctl exec` takes a single shell string it must re-parse, so the fake `prlctl` matches inside its third
//! argument - which is only possible because the controller really did collapse the command into one string. A
//! fake that matched the whole argv for both would let a concatenating call site pass unnoticed. `docker exec`
//! takes an argv as `tart exec` does, so the fake `docker` shares the `tart` exec arms.
//!
//! # Verbs
//!
//! The script records every argv, then answers the verbs the host tree spawns. Each verb's exit code comes from a
//! file, so the default is what an unseeded suite sees. [`Answer`] names every file and what reads it. Before any
//! verb, [`Answer::KilledVerb`] makes a call die by SIGKILL and [`Answer::SilentVerb`] makes it exit 0 with nothing
//! printed, for every fake of the directory, so a suite can show what a probe without an answer does.
//!
//! The `tart` verbs, which only the fake `tart` answers:
//!
//! - `ip` answers the loopback unconditionally.
//! - `run` fails by default, and that is the honest answer: a fake that was told nothing about the VM it was asked
//!   to boot did not boot one. A test that wants a live one seeds [`Answer::RunSleeps`], and the sleep is in a
//!   child rather than an `exec` - the recorded identity is `ps -o command=`, so a process that replaced its own
//!   argv would stop matching the receipt written a moment earlier.
//! - `exec -i <vm> <agent> relay <port>`, that whole argv and nothing more, becomes a relay to `127.0.0.1:<port>`
//!   on the host. That is how a suite over the production channel reaches a loopback listener of its own: the
//!   relay bytes go through the fake like they go through `tart exec`. The arm comes before the verb files, so a
//!   seeded `relay` file cannot hide it. See the relay of the script below.
//! - `exec` then answers by verb: the first argument without a `/` that has a file seeded by
//!   [`Fake::answer_exec_verb`] prints that file, exit 0. That is how a suite over the production guest channel
//!   answers the agent's `active` and `cancel` apart.
//! - `exec` serves the agent's `read-file <path>` from [`Answer::ReadFile`] on stdout and [`Answer::ReadFileReceipt`]
//!   on stderr, which is how a pull runs without a guest. A suite that seeds neither `read-file` file falls through
//!   to the shared `exec` answer, so a pull still reads its bytes from [`Answer::ExecStdout`]. A Parallels pull is a
//!   `base64` in a `prlctl exec` shell string, and it reads the shared answer too.
//!
//! The `prlctl` verbs, which only the fake `prlctl` answers:
//!
//! - `stop`, `start` and `suspend` are a state machine, because the operations under test are sequences rather
//!   than single calls: a `stop` has to make the *next* `list` say stopped, or the wait loop after it never
//!   returns. Each one copies a template the suite wrote over [`Answer::ListJson`]. A suite that seeded no
//!   template gets the state it already had.
//! - `exec` matches inside its third argument, for the reason above. A shell string that ends in `relay <port>`,
//!   with each word quoted or not, becomes the same relay on the host: the `prlctl` spelling of the `tart` relay
//!   arm.
//!
//! The `docker` verbs, which only the fake `docker` answers. One fake holds one container, so a Docker pool of
//! `avl_host_testkit` has one slot:
//!
//! - `version` prints [`Answer::DockerVersion`], `linux/arm64` when unseeded, and exits from
//!   [`Answer::VersionExit`].
//! - `inspect --type container --format <format> <name>` answers from [`Answer::ContainerState`], a
//!   `<status>/<exit code>` such as `running/0`. An `inspect` without `--type container` exits 2, so a suite proves
//!   the controller never asks for an object of another type. No such file is no container: exit 1, as
//!   `docker inspect` of an unknown name exits. A format that asks for `.State.Running` gets `true` or `false`,
//!   derived from the same file. A format that asks for `.Id` gets [`Answer::ContainerId`]. A failed read of the
//!   state is named on stderr, and the exit stays 0, so the controller's refusal of an answer without a state
//!   carries the reason.
//! - `create`, `start`, `stop` and `rm` are a state machine over that file, like the `prlctl` verbs: `create`
//!   writes `created/0`, `start` writes `running/0`, `stop` writes `exited/0` and `rm` removes it. Each exits from
//!   [`Answer::Exit`], and a nonzero exit changes nothing. A seeded [`Answer::StartedState`] is what `start` writes
//!   instead, for a container whose entrypoint exits at once.
//! - `create` also prints a new id, `fake-container-<n>`, and writes it over [`Answer::ContainerId`], so a
//!   container made again has another id, as on the engine.
//! - `rm` without `--force` exits 1 for a running container and changes nothing, as the engine refuses it.
//! - The images are a list of references. `build --tag <ref>`, a `pull <ref>` that succeeded and `tag <src> <ref>`
//!   add `<ref>`, and `image rm <ref>` removes it. `image inspect <ref>` exits 0 when the list holds `<ref>`, or
//!   when [`Answer::ImagePresent`] exists, which makes every reference present; else 1. With a `--format` that
//!   names `Labels` it prints [`Answer::ImageRevision`]. `build`, `tag` and `image rm` exit from [`Answer::Exit`],
//!   `pull` from [`Answer::PullExit`], 1 when unseeded, because a fake told nothing about a registry has no image
//!   there, and `buildx` (the multi-platform publish) from [`Answer::PushExit`].
//! - `exec -i <name> <agent> relay <port>` is the relay of the `tart` arm, and the other `exec` arms are the
//!   `tart` ones too.
//! - `volume`, `logs` and anything else exit from [`Answer::Exit`].
//!
//! The `limactl` verbs, which only the fake `limactl` answers. One fake holds one instance, the Docker engine, under
//! the `LIMA_HOME` its caller sets; without one it exits 2:
//!
//! - `list --format {{.Status}} <name>` prints [`Answer::LimaState`]. No such file is no instance: exit 1 with the
//!   "No instance matching" warning, as `limactl` answers.
//! - `start` copies a template argument (`*.yaml`) to [`LIMA_TEMPLATE_COPY`], then exits from
//!   [`Answer::LimaStartExit`]. A start that succeeds writes `Running` over [`Answer::LimaState`] and creates the
//!   forwarded socket `$LIMA_HOME/<name>/sock/docker.sock` as a plain file.
//! - `stop` writes `Stopped` and removes the socket. `delete` removes the state and `$LIMA_HOME/<name>`.
//!
//! The shared verbs, which both answer:
//!
//! - `--version` and `list` exit 0 unless a suite seeds the code. Both backends' gates check what a hypervisor too
//!   old or too broken to answer does to the version gate.
//! - `list` answers [`Answer::ListJson`], which is the JSON of `tart list --format json` and of
//!   `prlctl list -a -i -j` alike. `tart list --quiet` is a line-for-line name list rather than JSON, so it is a
//!   second question with a second answer file, [`Answer::ListQuiet`]. `prlctl` has no `--quiet` listing.
//! - `status` answers [`Answer::Status`], which only `prlctl` has a verb for. It stays shared because the observer
//!   drives both backends over one set of answers.
//! - `exec` prints [`Answer::ExecStdout`] and [`Answer::ExecStderr`] and exits from [`Answer::ExecExit`]. This is
//!   the answer for a guest command no backend-specific arm claimed.
//! - Anything else - `clone`, `set`, `delete`, and `tart stop` - is recorded and exits from [`Answer::Exit`],
//!   because for those the controller cares that it was asked, not what came back.
//!
//! # Windows
//!
//! A Windows host runs no shell script, and it has the Docker backend only. There the fake `docker` is the program of
//! [`crate::fakebin`], a port of the `docker` verbs of the script, linked into the directory as `docker.exe`. The
//! answer files and the call log are the same. A fake `tart` or `prlctl` does not exist on Windows.
//!
//! # One file per content
//!
//! The executable of every fake is a hard link to one file that all test processes share, the script on Unix and the
//! program on Windows. The file is named by its content (`crate::shared`), so only the first process after a change of
//! the fake writes a new executable file, which macOS scans at its first exec.
