/**
 * Tests [ReplayWalker] over histories long enough that its [ItemTree] grows inner levels. The other
 * replay tests walk a few items, so their tree stays one leaf.
 *
 * The text of a branch comes from [DocumentText][com.intellij.openapi.editor.ex.experimental.DocumentText] ops,
 * and not from a walk. So it is an oracle for a full replay of a history of one agent. A merge has
 * no such oracle, and its partial replay must give the text of a full replay. The tests also pin
 * that the replay of a linear history never builds the unit index of the tree.
