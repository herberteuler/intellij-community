/**
 * Runs graph values on several threads at once.
 *
 * A graph value is immutable, and successive values SHARE the nodes of their run trees and agent
 * indexes: an append copies only the path it changes. So a value needs no lock, and a value that
 * one thread reads must stay unchanged while another thread grows a newer value from it. These
 * tests run that claim. They are the regression net for any structure that a later change makes
 * mutable and shared.
 *
 * The newest run of a value is not in the trees. It lives in the value, and an append that
 * extends it copies no node at all. The trees receive a run only when an append that does not
 * continue it closes it. So a test that must reach the trees either types in bursts or inserts
 * at the front, where no op continues the one before it.
 *
 * Every assertion here holds whatever the scheduling, so a failure is a real defect and not
 * a flake. The one thing the tests cannot control is how much the threads overlap, so each
 * one also asserts that the work actually happened.
 *
 * What these tests do NOT claim: that a document is thread safe. Two threads that apply an
 * op to ONE value under ONE agent both mint the same (agent, seq) and diverge. That breaks
 * the agent contract of [DocBranch], and no lock would fix it. Each writer below therefore owns
 * its own agent.
