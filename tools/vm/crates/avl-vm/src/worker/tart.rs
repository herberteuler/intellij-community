//! The Tart backend: the binary itself, the sealed golden image a worker is cloned from, the provenance receipt that
//! ties a running worker back to that seal, and how a share is declared to `tart run`.
//!
//! Parallels has no equivalent of the last three - it provisions lazily from a VM the operator already owns - and
//! declares its shares through `prlctl set` instead. Most of what is here exists to make a *sealed* image
//! trustworthy, and to recognise the controller's own run process again after the fact.
//!
//! # A worker is a host process here
//!
//! A Parallels worker is a VM the hypervisor keeps for you and `prlctl status` will tell you about; a Tart worker is
//! a long-lived `tart run` process this controller spawned, and when that process is gone the machine is gone with
//! it. So liveness is not a hypervisor query, it is process identification - and identifying a process by pid alone
//! is how a recycled pid gets mistaken for a live worker. Hence the triple in [`ProcessIdentity`]: the pid, the
//! process's start time, and its command line, all three of which have to still agree.
