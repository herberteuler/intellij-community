   *
   * Two things make [historyMark]'s count unusable, and reset [screenTop] to zero through
   * [isHistoryReplaced] — deferring the (expensive) scrollback read until the output stops, because what
   * was lost was the *ability* to read it cheaply, not the content itself:
   * 1. [historyMark] returning `null` (the marked boundary was itself evicted, so the old numbering is unrecoverable).
   * 2. One update finalizing more than [HISTORY_REPLACE_LINES] rows, where reading them all costs more than the content is worth.
   *
   * **The trade-off**: as long as anything keeps scrolling (output arrives faster than
   * [OUTPUT_POLL_INTERVAL]), the model holds only the visible screen until the output slows down to not
   * finalize any rows during a projection window, so steady output that never pauses keeps its scrollback
   * hidden until it stops. But it should be an exceptional case when - even if it adds one line every 20ms,
   * it is still 50 new lines a second.
   *
   * A third case resets [screenTop] to zero the same way but *without* [isHistoryReplaced]: the
   * scrollback being erased (`CSI 3 J`, what `clear` sends). [historyMark] cannot report that on its own —
   * it relocates its pin instead of evicting it, so the count reads as a misleadingly ordinary `0` — so this
   * instead notices [TerminalEmulator.scrollbackRows] drop to `0` with no resize to explain it.
