/**
 * An immutable document that records its edit history in an Eg-walker [EventGraph]
 * (arXiv 2409.14252). Two divergent copies of one document can then [merge] without losing either
 * side.
 *
 * The branch is a value: [applyOp], [fork], and [merge] return a new branch. [text] gives the
 * document at the branch's version. A merge costs the size of the change and of the concurrent
 * region, not the size of the history.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - Branches that edit concurrently must edit under different [Agent]s. [fork] sets the agent.
 *   Two concurrent edits under one agent can make a merge throw [EventIdClashException], or build
 *   a wrong text.
 * - [merge] expects branches that descend from one [createBranch] value. Branches with no
 *   common history merge into a concatenated document.
 * - `a.merge(b)` and `b.merge(a)` produce the same text. A merge with an ancestor changes
 *   nothing. A merge with a descendant fast-forwards. A repeated merge changes nothing.
