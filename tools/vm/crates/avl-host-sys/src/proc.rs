//! Every subprocess this controller starts, and the one interface a guest command goes through.
//!
//! Two things here are contracts rather than conveniences.
//!
//! **A host command fails with what it said; a guest command does not.** `prlctl` and its peers act on the VM from
//! the host and their output carries paths and VM state, so withholding it - which the controller used to - turned
//! every backend failure into `prlctl exited with 1` and nothing else. Guest output stays withheld, because a guest
//! process can echo the UI-test bridge token. That asymmetry is [`Runner::checked`] versus
//! [`Runner::checked_quietly`], and it is the reason they are two methods.
//!
//! **[`Channel`] is the seam the fakes implement.** A test implementation answers a guest command directly, so no
//! layer that makes a real process behave like a guest has to exist. It also opens a [`GuestStream`] to a guest
//! port, which a test implementation answers with an in-process stream.
//!
//! Every captured child has a timeout, because [`SpawnOptions`] has no default: each spawn site names its own. When
//! it expires, the runner kills the process group of the child and answers [`ProcError::TimedOut`]. Three shapes
//! have no timeout, because their end belongs to somebody else: [`Runner::inherited`], an interactive session that
//! the operator ends; [`Runner::spawn_piped`], the relay stream that its HTTP client bounds; and
//! [`Runner::spawn_session`], a child that is meant to outlive the controller.
//!
//! Every child runs in its own process group, so a timeout, a cancellation or a forwarded signal reaches the whole
//! tree: `tart exec` spawns an ssh client which spawns the guest command, and killing only the parent leaves the
//! guest running and the next operation finds the run slot taken. A spawn whose future is dropped signals its group
//! as it goes, so an abandoned operation strands nothing. The exception is [`Runner::spawn_session`], whose child
//! is meant to outlive the controller. The `group` module is the seam that makes a group on Unix and on Windows.
