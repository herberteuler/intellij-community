//! The guest half: the run supervisor, the runtime stager, provisioning verbs and the agent binary.
//!
//! One static binary. The controller pushes it into the guest and invokes it over the one exec channel each
//! hypervisor offers. The reason it is a typed binary is that every silent defect the controller has had lived on
//! this side of the wire: a 64-bit content hash rounded by `JSON.parse`, an outcome string that two
//! hand-maintained lists disagreed about.
//!
//! The verbs do not collide: `start|supervise|status|active|log|cancel` are the run supervisor's,
//! `stage|stage-check|launch-prep|gc` are the stager's, `provision-image|validate-image` build the macOS golden
//! image, `provision-guest|validate-guest|stage-node|check-node` make a Linux worker out of a booted public clone,
//! and `trace-pack-ready` zips the trace bundles that finished since the last pull with `air-trace pack`'s own
//! code. `relay` bridges its standard streams to a guest loopback port, which is how the controller reaches the UI
//! daemon. `read-file` copies one file to its standard output unchanged, which is how the controller pulls a file. `runfiles-tree` builds the runfiles tree of a host MANIFEST, for a Windows host that writes no tree.
//!
//! The image pair takes three named flags (`--macos-version --node-major --junie-version`), because the Packer
//! template `air-macos.pkr.hcl` passes them by name. The four Linux verbs take positional argv: an absolute path,
//! a `:88`, an account name and an absolute path are four shapes no transposition survives.
//!
//! This crate is dispatch plus the verbs. The documents that cross to the host, and every verb's name, are declared
//! in `avl-wire`, where the host reads the same declaration; the pack report is `avl-trace-tools`'. It depends on
//! `avl-wire` and `avl-trace-tools` alone, never on `avl-base`, so the agent links no controller code.
