/**
 * See [DocMerge]. The ops are ready when the merge replayed and recorded them. They are deferred
 * when the merge needed no replay, because the ops would cost one.
 *
 * Thread safety: the branch and a ready list are final. A deferred list sits behind a lazy value in
 * the publication mode. Two threads that ask at once can both build it, but every caller gets the
 * one list that won. No lock is held while the replay runs. The build reads only immutable values,
 * so a second build gives an equal list. After the build the lazy value drops the computation, and
 * with it the values that only the computation needed.
