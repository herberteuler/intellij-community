//! Worker lifecycle: the readiness gates every lease operation runs first, the `pool` commands that create, start
//! and stop a worker, and the lease document.
//!
//! The readiness *contract* is one contract for every backend. A lease operation needs a worker whose guest answers,
//! whose console is logged in, and whose parity layout describes this checkout. It needs that whether the machine
//! underneath is a `tart run` process, a VM the operator made or a container the controller created. How a backend
//! brings a worker there is the body in the file of that backend.
//!
//! # Where each part lives
//!
//! - `worker/lifecycle.rs`: the one dispatch of the lifecycle operations (the readiness gates, start, stop and the
//!   `pool` operations), each a `match` on the [`Machine`], and the lease guard of a lifecycle operation. It also
//!   holds the Linux half of a boot, which a Tart Linux worker and a Docker worker share.
//! - `worker/tart.rs`: the Tart lifecycle, Unix only as the Tart backend is. It also writes the two pieces of host state that only a Tart worker has.
//!   The run process's pid receipt records the identity that recognises the process again. Reading it back is
//!   [`Tart::read_process_identity`]. The suspended-state record says what the worker was suspended *with*. The
//!   next start reads it to tell a safe resume from a resume against a changed device declaration.
//! - `worker/parallels.rs`: the Parallels lifecycle, `prlctl` against a VM the operator made. Unix only.
//! - `worker/docker.rs`: the Docker lifecycle, the image and the container of each slot.
//! - `worker/pool.rs`: the `pool` commands. `pool init` and `pool recycle` take the locks and check the leases,
//!   then ask the lifecycle. `pool gc` locks each slot inside the backend. `pool start` and `pool stop` take their
//!   lock in `worker/lifecycle.rs`.
//!
//! This file keeps what every backend shares: the lifecycle locks, the guest channel, the share refresh, and the
//! lease document.
//!
//! The lease document is not the lease *policy*, which is [`crate::worker::lease`]. It is the file, read beside the pid
//! receipt and the suspended state in the same worker directory. The stop path has to know whether a worker is
//! leased, so the lower module must be able to read one without the policy that writes it.
