/**
 * What a merge of [other] into [dest] will append, worked out before anything is appended.
 *
 * The plan is what makes a merge ATOMIC. Building it reads both graphs and can reject, but
 * it changes nothing, so a rejected merge leaves no run behind. Applying it cannot reject.
 *
 * The plan holds one entry per run of [other] that carries a unit [dest] lacks, in ASCENDING
 * lv order. That order is required: a parent always sits at a smaller lv, so appending in it
 * puts every parent in place before its child names it.
 *
 * [destStarts] is the part that needs explaining. A run of [other] may name a parent that the
 * plan itself is about to bring in, and [dest] does not hold it yet. So the plan reserves the lv
 * of every entry up front and answers such a parent from the reservation, arithmetically. That
 * also spares an index lookup for each parent inside the new region.
