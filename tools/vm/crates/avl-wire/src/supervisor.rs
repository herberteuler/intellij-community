//! The run supervisor's wire, declared once for both halves of the UI lane controller.
//!
//! The two halves used to declare it twice, and the cost of that is on the record: a fake supervisor answered
//! `cancelled` for months while the real one has always written `canceled`. So nothing outside this module
//! spells a phase or an outcome; a list that exists once cannot disagree with itself.
//!
//! What this module deliberately does *not* replace is the `contract` verb. The verb answers a different
//! question: what does the agent that is already installed in this guest speak? The controller compares the
//! agent's self-reported digest before deciding whether to reinstall, so `contract` is on the fast path of
//! every lease operation, not only in a test. The host and the agent share this module, so every document here
//! decodes exactly what it writes.
