//! `flake`: K repeat trials of one selection, spread over the workers it could lease, folded into a per-class flake
//! rate.
//!
//! Why this is a verb of its own and not `run --repeat N`. `run` is one lock, one worker, one report, and every
//! caller reads it that way. A repeat *inside* it would be pinned to the single worker its receipt names and would
//! have to pick one of K reports to return; a repeat *outside* it is a new command wearing `run`'s name, whose failure
//! modes (`tests_failed` at exit 6 on the third of twelve trials) are the wrong answer to the question being asked.
//! Measuring intermittency is a different act from running a lane once, so it says so.
//!
//! The arithmetic is not here. [`avl_report::aggregate::flake_summary`] owns the buckets, the Wilson intervals, the
//! exclusion of unmeasurable trials and the honesty guard that refuses to publish a rate over a biased sample; this
//! module runs trials and hands them over. Two implementations of "what is a flake" would eventually disagree.
//!
//! - [`plan`]: the trial plan, the reset between trials, and the fold's inputs and text;
//! - [`command`]: the per-worker trial chains and the reply.
